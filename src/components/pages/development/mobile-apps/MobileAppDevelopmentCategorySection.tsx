              Mobile apps are an integral part of our lives. They accompany us. From early to late. Day and night. Always and everywhere. When your smart alarm clock gently wakes you up early in the morning. Then start the weather app. Check your social media profiles over breakfast. And chat with your work colleagues while having a cup of coffee.
