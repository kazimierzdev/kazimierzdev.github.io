              Phew... where should we ask? Good apps are more than just technology and technology. They create user joy. Are beautiful and desirable. Work quickly and well – like a Swiss watch. Make people&apos;s lives simpler and easier. Meet and exceed expectations – of people and companies. Ensure long-term use. Create competitive advantages, unique position and economic success.
