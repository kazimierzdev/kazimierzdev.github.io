            <h4 className="text-black text-4xl font-bold mb-8">... and what are we competing for?</h4>
            <p className="text-xl text-light-grey mt-4 mb-12">Very easy. We create real competitive advantages with apps. Enable new, digital business models. Conquer markets and the hearts of your target groups. Create desirable products that people use and buy. And make your competition jealous. So that you can do more with apps.</p>
            <h4 className="text-black text-4xl font-bold mb-8">touching people. With every single pixel.</h4>
            <p className="text-xl text-light-grey mt-4 mb-12">However, the true core of what we do runs even deeper. It&apos;s a real matter of the heart for us: everything we do is about creating unique apps that make people&apos;s lives a little better. For us, every single pixel that brings joy and inspires enthusiasm counts. When apps touch people emotionally. Become an important part of their lives and give them something back. With lots of wows and yeahs. When an app becomes a “personal piece of software”. And people can never get enough of it.</p>
            <h4 className="text-black text-4xl font-bold mb-8">Handmade by artisans.</h4>
            <p className="text-xl text-light-grey mt-4 mb-12">We at TechVoyageSolution GmbH are highly specialized digital craftsmen and specialists from various fields who work together to develop unique apps. For joy and fun. Your digital heart is in the right place. With high standards, craftsmanship and the irrepressible urge for something new. And almost obsessed: with apps that do something good and make the world a better place.</p>
